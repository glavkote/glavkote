ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pascha - Senior Unix/Linux Systems Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience. Involved in IT since 2008, with formal engineering roles since 2015. My skills focus on free and open-source technologies, with extensive experience in GNU/Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, virtualization, automation scripting, web service deployment, and information security. I have over five years of practical experience in networking, but it is no longer my primary area of focus. I'm currently expanding my expertise in DevOps and infrastructure as code (IaC), and regularly work with tools like Git, CI/CD pipelines, SaltStack, and container runtimes. I'm continuously developing my skill set with the goal of transitioning into a full-time DevOps engineer role.
